# NGS Analysis Automation using NextFlow
Overview
This repository implements a modular and reproducible germline variant calling pipeline using Nextflow. It automates a standard short-read variant discovery workflow based on the GATK Best Practices, and is designed for analyzing large-scale whole exome or whole genome sequencing data.
The pipeline supports parallel execution, reproducibility, and easy scaling across local machines, HPC clusters, or cloud environments.
